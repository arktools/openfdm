<p>
Library <b>MultiBodyOmc</b> is a <b>free</b> Modelica package providing
3-dimensional mechanical components to model in a convenient way
<b>mechanical systems</b>, such as robots, mechanisms, vehicles.
A basic feature is that all components have <b>animation</b> information
with appropriate default sizes and colors. A typical screenshot of the
animation of a double pendulum is shown in the figure below, together
with its schematic.

  ALT=\"double pendulum (diagram layer)\">
<p>
Note, that all components - the coordinate system of the world frame,
the gravity acceleration vector, the revolute joints and the
bodies - are visualized in the animation.<br>
This library replaces the long available ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc
library, since it is much more easier to use and more powerful.
The main features of the library are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>About <b>60 main components</b>, i.e., joint, force, part,
    body, sensor and visualizer components that are ready to use
    and have useful default animation properties. One-dimensional
    force laws can be defined with components of the Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational
    and of the Modelica.Mechanics.Translational library and can be
    connected via available flange connectors to MultiBodyOmc
    components.
<li>About <b>75 functions</b> to operate in a convenient way on
    orientation objects, e.g., to transform vector quantities between
    frames, or compute the orientation object of a planar rotation.
    The basic idea is to hide the actual definition of an <b>orientation</b>
    by providing essentially an <b>Orientation</b> type together with
    <b>functions</b> operating on instances of this type. Orientation
    objects based on a 3x3 transformation matrix and on quaternions
    are provided. As a side effect, the equations in all other
    components are simpler and easier to understand.</li>
<li> <b>A World model</b> has to be present in every model on top
     level. Here the gravity field is defined (currently: no gravity,
     uniform gravity, point gravity), the visualization of the
     world coordinate system and default settings for animation.
     If a world model is not present, it is automatically provided
     together with a warning message.
<li><b>Built-in animation properties</b> of all components, such as
    joints, forces, bodies, sensors. This allows an easy visual
    check of the constructed model. Animation of every component
    can be switched off via a parameter. The animation of a complete
    system can be switched off via one parameter in the <b>world</b>
    model. If animation is switched off, all equations related
    to animation are removed from the generated code. This is especially
    important for real-time simulation.</li>
<li><b>Automatic handling of kinematic loops</b>.
    Components can be connected together in a nearly arbitrary fashion.
    It does not matter whether components are flipped. This does not
    influence the efficiency. If kinematic loop structures occur,
    this is automatically handeled in an efficient way by a new
    technique to transform a certain class of overdetermined sets of
    differential algebraic equations symbolically to a system where
    the number of equations and unknowns are the same (the user need
    <b>not</b> cut loops with special cut-joints to construct a
    tree-structure). </li>
<li><b>Automatic state selection from joints and bodies</b>.
    Most joints and all bodies have potential states. A Modelica
    translator, such as Dymola, will use the generalized coordinates
    of joints as states if possible. If this is not possible,
    states are selected from body coordinates. As a consequence,
    strange joints with 6 degrees of freedom are not necessary
    to define a body moving freely in space. An advanced user
    may select states manually from the <b>Advanced</b> menu of the
    corresponding components or use a Modelica parameter modification
    to set the \"stateSelect\" attribute directly. </li>
<li> <b>Analytic solution of kinematic loops</b>. The non-linear
    equations occuring in kinematic loops are solved <b>analytically</b>
    for a large class of mechanisms, such as a 4 bar mechanism,
    a slider-crank mechanism or a MacPherson suspension. This is performed
    by constructing such loops with assembly joints JointXXX,
    available in the MultiBodyOmc.Joints package. Assembly joints consist
    of 3 joints that have together 6 degrees of freedom, i.e., no
    constraints.They do not have potential states. When the motion
    of the two frame connectors are provided, a non-linear system of
    equation is solved analytically to compute the motion of the 3 joints.
    Analytic loop handling is especially important for real-time simulation.</li>
<li> <b>Line force components may have mass</b>.
     Masses of line force components are located on the line on which
     the force is acting. They approximate the mass properties of
     a real physical device by one or two point masses. For example,
     a spring has often significant mass that has to be taken into
     account. If masses are set to zero, the additional code to handle
     these point masses is removed. If the masses are taken into
     account, the calculation overhead is small (the reason is that
     the occuring kinematic loops are analytically solved).<br>
     Note, in this Beta-release, not all provided line force
     components have already an optional mass. This will be fixed
     in the next release.</li>
<li> <b>Force components may be connected directly together</b>, e.g.,
     3-dimensional springs in series connection. Usually,
     multi-body programs have the restriction that force components
     can only be connected between two bodies. Such restrictions are
     not present in the Modelica multi-body library, since it is
     a fully object-oriented, equation based library. Usually, if
     force components are connected directly together, non-linear
     systems of equations occur. The advantage is often, that this
     may avoid stiff systems that would occur if a small mass has
     to be put in between the two force elements.</li>
<li><b>Initialization definition is available via menus</b>.
    Initialization of states in joints and bodies can be
    performed in the parameter menu, <b>without</b> typing Modelica
    statements. For non-standard initialization, the usual
    Modelica commands can be used.</li>
<li><b>Multi-body specific error messages</b>. Annotations
    and assert statements have been introduced that provide
    in many cases warning or error messages that are related
    to the library components (and not to specific equations
    as it is usual in Modelica libraries). This requires
    appropriate tool support, as it is, e.g., available in Dymola.</li>
<li><b>Inverse models</b> of mechanical systems can be easily
    defined by using motion generators, e.g.,
    Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Position. Also, non-standard
    inverse models can be generated, e.g., when elasticity is present
    it might be necessary to differentiate equations several times.</li>

As a first example it shall be demonstrated how to build up, simulate
and animate a <b>simple pendulum</b>.
</p>
<p>
A simple pendulum consisting of a <b>body</b> and a <b>revolute</b> joint
with <b>linear damping</b> in the joint, is first build-up as
Modelica composition diagram, resulting in:
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/FirstExample/PenulumSchematic1.png\"
ALT=\"Modelica composition diagram of simple pendulum\">

<p>
In the following figure the location of the used
model components is shown. Drag these components in the diagram layer
and connect them according to the figure:
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/FirstExample/PenulumSchematic2.png\">
</p>
<p>
Every model that uses model components from the MultiBodyOmc library
must have an instance of the MultiBodyOmc.World model on highest level.
The reason is that in the world object the gravity field is defined
(uniform gravity or point gravity), as well as the default sizes of
animation shapes and this information is reported to all used
components. If the World object is missing, a warning message is
printed and an instance of the World object with default settings is
automatically utilized (this feature is defined with annotations and
is, e.g., supported by Dymola).
</p>
<p>
In a second step the parameters of the dragged components need to be
defined. Some parameters are vectors that have to be defined with respect
to a local coordinate system of the corresponding component. The easiest
way to perform this is to define a <b>reference configuration</b> of your
multi-body model: In this configuration, the relative coordinates of
all joints are zero. This means that all coordinate systems on all
components are parallel to each other. Therefore, this just means
that all vectors are resolved in the world frame in this configuration.
</p>
<p>
The reference configuration for the simple pendulum shall be defined
in the following way: The y-axis of the world frame is directed
upwards, i.e., the opposite direction of the gravity acceleration.
The x-axis of the world frame is orthogonal to it. The revolute joint
is placed in the origin of the world frame. The rotation axis of the revolute
joint is directed along the z-axis of the world frame. The body is
placed on the x-axis of the world frame (i.e., the rotation angle of the
revolute joint is zero, when the body is on the x-axis).
In the following figures the definition of this reference configuration
is shown in the parameter menus of the revolute joint and the body:
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/FirstExample/ActuatedRevolute.png\">
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/FirstExample/Body.png\">
</p>
<p>
Translate and simulate the model, e.g., with Dymola.
Automatically, all defined components are visualized in
an animation using default absolute or relative sizes
of the components. For example, a body is visualized as
a sphere and as a cylinder. The default size of the sphere is defined
as parameter in the world object. You may change this size
in the \"Animation\" parameter menu of the body (see parameter menu
above). The default size of the cylinder is defined relatively
to the size of the sphere (half of the sphere size).
With default settings, the following animation is defined:
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/FirstExample/Pendulum.png\">
</p>
<p>
The world coordinate system is visualized as coordinate system
with axes labels. The direction of the gravity acceleration
vector is shown as green arrow. The red cylinder represents
the rotation axis of the revolute joint and the light blue
shapes represent the body. The center of mass of the body is
in the middle of the light blue sphere.

In principal, now special action is needed, if
loop structures occur (contrary to the ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc library).
An example is presented in the figure below. It is available as
<a href=\"Modelica://MultiBodyOmc.Examples.Loops.Fourbar1\">
MultiBodyOmc.Examples.Loops.Fourbar1</a>
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/Fourbar1a.png\">
</p>
<p>
This mechanism consists of 6 revolute joints, 1 prismatic joint and forms a
kinematical loop.
It has has one degree of freedom. In the next figure the default animation
is shown. Note, that the axes of the revolute joints are represented by the
red cylinders and that the axis of the prismatic joint is represented by the
red box on the lower right side.
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/Fourbar1b.png\" width=\"205\" height=\"107\">
</p>
<p>
Whenever loop structures occur, non-linear algebraic
equations are present on \"position level\". It is then usually not possible by
structural analysis to select states during translation (which is possible for
non-loop structures). In the example above, Dymola detects a non-linear
algebraic loop of 57 equations and reduces this to a system of 7 coupled
algebraic equations. Note, that this is performed without using any
\"cut-joints\" as it is usually done in multi-body programs, but by just
appropriate symbolic equation manipulation. Via the dynamic dummy derivative
method the generalized coordinates on position and velocity level from one of
the 7 joints are dynamically selected as states during simulation. Whenever,
these two states are no longer appropriate, states from one of the other
joints are selected during simulation.
</p>
<p>
The efficiency of loop structures can usually be
enhanced, if states are statically fixed at translation time. For this
mechanism, the generalized coordinates of joint j1 (i.e., the
rotation angle of the revolute joint and its derivative) can always be used as
states. This can be stated by setting parameter \"enforceStates = <b>true</b>\"
in the \"Advanced\" menu of the desired joint. This flag sets the attribute
stateSelect of the generalized coordinates of the coresponding joint to
\"StateSelect.always\". When setting this flag to <b>true</b> for joint j1 in
the four bar mechanism, Dymola detects a non-linear algebraic loop of 40
equations and reduces this to a system of 5 coupled non-linear algebraic
equations.
</p>
<p>
In many mechanisms it is possible to solve the non-linear algebraic
equations analytically. For a certain class of systems this can
be performed also with the MultiBodyOmc library. This technique
is described in section
\"<a href=\"Modelica://MultiBodyOmc.UsersGuide.Tutorial.LoopStructures.AnalyticLoopHandling\">Analytic loop handling</a>\".

In the figure below, the model of a V6 engine is
shown that has a simple combustion model. It is available as
<a href=\"Modelica://MultiBodyOmc.Examples.Loops.EngineV6\">

The Modelica schematic of one cylinder
is given in the figure below. Connecting 6 instances of this
cylinder appropriately together results in the engine schematic displayed
above.
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_2.png\">
</p>
<p>
In the next figure the animation of the engine is
shown. Every cylinder consists essentially of 1 prismatic and 2 revolute
joints that form a planar loop, since the axes of the two revolute joints are
parallel to each other and the axis of the prismatic joint is orthogonal to
the revolute joint axes. All 6 cylinders together form a coupled set of 6
loops that have together 1 degree of freedom.
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_3.png\" width=\"303\" height=\"136\">
</p>
<p>
All planar loops, and especially the engine, result in
a DAE (= Differential-Algebraic Equation system)
that does not have a unique solution. The reason is that, e.g., the cut
forces in direction of the axes of the revolute joints cannot be uniquely
computed. Any value fulfills the DAE equations. This is a structural property
that is determined by the symbolic algorithms. Since they detect that the DAE is
structurally singular, a further processing is not possible. Without
additional information it is also impossible that the symbolic algorithms
could be enhanced because if the axes of rotations of the revolute joints are
only slightly changed such that they are no longer parallel to each other, the
planar loop can no longer move and has 0 degrees of freedom. Algorithms based
on pure structural information cannot distinguish these two cases.
</p>
<p>
The usual remedy is to remove superfluous constraints,
e.g., along the axis of rotation of <b>one</b> revolute joint. Since this is
not easy for an inexperienced modeler, the special joint:
<a href=\"Modelica://MultiBodyOmc.Joints.RevolutePlanarLoopConstraint\">
RevolutePlanarLoopConstraint</a> is provided that removes these constraints.
Exactly one revolute joint in a every planar loop must be replaced by this
joint type. In the engine example, this special joinst is used for
the revolute joint B2 in the cylinder model above. The icon of the joint is
slightly different to other revolute joints to visualize this case.
</p>
<p>
If a modeler is not aware of the problems with planar
loops and models them without special consideration, a Modelica
translator, such as Dymola, displays an error
message and points out that a planar loop may be the reason and suggests to
use the RevolutePlanarLoopConstraint joint.
This error message is due to an annotation in
the Frame connector.
</p>
<pre>
  <b>connector</b> Frame
     ...
     <b>flow</b> SI.Force f[3] <b>annotation</b>(unassignedMessage=\"..\");
  <b>end</b> Frame;
</pre>
<p>
If no assignment can be found for some
forces in a connector, the \"unassignedMessage\" is displayed. In most cases the
reason for this is a planar loop or two joints that constrain the same motion.
Both cases are discussed in the error message.
</p>
<p>
Note, that the non-linear algebraic equations occurring
in planar loops can be solved analytically in most cases and therefore it is
highly recommended to use the techniques discussed in section
\"<a href=\"Modelica://MultiBodyOmc.UsersGuide.Tutorial.LoopStructures.AnalyticLoopHandling\">Analytic loop handling</a>\"
for such systems.

      class AnalyticLoopHandling "Analytic loop handling"

        annotation (Documentation(info="<HTML>
It is well known that the non-linear
algebraic equations of most mechanical loops in technical devices can be
solved analytically. It is, however, difficult to perform this fully
automatically and therefore none of the commercial, general purpose multi-body
programs, such as MSC ADAMS, LMS DADS, SIMPACK, have this feature.
These programs solve loop structures with pure numerical methods. Multi-body
programs that are designed for real-time simulation of the dynamics of
specific vehicles, such as ve-DYNA, usually contain manual implementations
of a particular multi-body system (the vehicle) where the occurring loops are
either analytically solved, if this is possible, or are treated by table
look-up where the tables are constructed in a pre-processing phase. Without
these features the required real-time capability would be difficult to
achieve.
</p>
<p>
In a series of papers and dissertations
Prof. Hiller and his group in Duisburg, Germany,
have developed systematic methods to handle mechanical
loops analytically. The \"characteristic pair of joints\" method
basically cuts a loop at two joints and uses geometric
invariants to reduce the number of algebraic
equations, often down to one equation that can be solved analytically. Also
several multi-body codes have been developed that are based on this method,
e.g., MOBILE. Besides the very desired feature to solve non-linear
algebraic equations analytically, i.e., efficiently and in a robust way, there
are several drawbacks: It is difficult to apply this method automatically.
Even if this would be possible in a good way, there is always the problem that
it cannot be guaranteed that the statically selected states lead to no
singularity during simulation. Therefore, the \"characteristic pair of joints\"
method is usually manually applied which requires know-how and experience.
</p>
<p>
In the MultiBodyOmc library the \"characteristic pair of
joints\" method is supported in a restricted form such that it can be applied
also by non-specialists. The idea is to provide aggregations of joints in package
<a href=\"Modelica://MultiBodyOmc.Joints.Assemblies\">
MultiBodyOmc.Joints.Assemblies</a>.
as one object that either have <b>6</b> degrees of freedom or
<b>3</b> degrees of freedom (for usage in planar loops).
</p>
<p>
As an example, a variant of the four bar mechanism is given in
the figure below.
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/FourbarAnalytic1.png\">
</p>
<p>
Here, the mechanism is modeled with one revolute
joint, two spherical joints and one prismatic joint.
In the figure below, the two spherical joints
and the prismatic joint are collected together in an assembly object
called \"jointSSP\" from
<a href=\"Modelica://MultiBodyOmc.Joints.Assemblies.JointSSP\">
MultiBodyOmc.Joints.Assemblies.JointSSP</a>.
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/FourbarAnalytic2.png\">
</p>
<p>
The JointSSP joint aggregation has a frame at the
left side of the left spherical joint (frame_a) and a frame at the right side
of the prismatic joint (frame_b). JointSSP, as all other objects from the
Joints.Assemblies package, has the property, that the <b>generalized
coordinates, and all other frames
defined in the assembly, can be calculated given the movement of frame_a and
of frame_b</b>. This is performed by <b>analytically</b> solving non-linear
systems of equations (details are given in section xxx). From a
structural point of view, the equations in an assembly object are written in
the form
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
  <b>q</b> = <b>
  f</b><sub>1</sub>(<b>r</b><sup>a</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>a</sup>,<b> r</b><sup>b</sup>,
  <b>R</b><sup>b</sup>)
</p>
<p>
where<b> r</b><sup>a</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>a</sup>,<b>
r</b><sup>b</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>b</sup><b> </b>are the variables defining the
position and orientation of the frame_a and frame_b connector,
<b>q</b> are the generalized positional coordinates inside the
assembly, e.g., the angle of a revolute joint. Given angle
<span style=\"font-family:Symbol\">j</span> of revolute joint j1 from the four
bar mechanism, frame_a and frame_b of the assembly object can be computed by a
forward recursion
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
(<b>r</b><sup>a</sup>,
<b>R</b><sup>a</sup>,<b> r</b><sup>b</sup>, <b>R</b><sup>b</sup>) = <b>f</b>(<span style=\"font-family:Symbol\">j)</span>
</p>
<p>
Since this is a structural property, the
symbolic algorithms can automatically select <span style=\"font-family:Symbol\">
j</span> and its derivative as states and then all positional variables can be
computed in a forwards sequence. It is now understandable that a Modelica
translator, such as Dymola, can
transform the equations of the four bar mechanism to a recursive sequence of
statements that has no non-linear algebraic loops anymore(remember,
the previous \"straightforward\" solution with 6 revolute joints and 1
prismatic joint has a nonlinear system of equations of order 5).
</p>
<p>
The aggregated joint
objects consist of a combination of either a revolute or prismatic joint and
of a rod that has either two spherical joints at its two ends or a spherical
and a universal joint, respectively. For all combinations, analytic solutions
can be determined. For planar loops, combinations of 1, 2 or 3 revolute joints
with parallel axes and of 2 or 1 prismatic joint with axes that are orthogonal
to the revolute joints can be treated analytically. The currently supported
combinations are listed in the table below.
The missing combinations (such as JointSUP
or Joint RPP) will be added in one of the next releases.

On first view this seems to be quite restrictive. However, mechanical devices are usually built up with rods connected by spherical joints on each end,
and additionally with revolute and prismatic joints.
Therefore, the combinations of the above table occur frequently.
The universal joint is usually not present in actual devices but is used
(a) if two JointXXX components can be connected such that a revolute
and a universal joint together form a spherical joint
and (b) if the orientation of the connecting rod between two
spherical joints is needed, e.g., since a body shall be attached.
In this case one of the spherical joints might be replaced by a
universal joint. This approximation is fine as long as the mass
and inertia of the rod is not significant.
</p>
<p>
Let us discuss item (a) in more detail: The
MacPherson suspension in the next figure
is from the Modelica VehicleDynamics library.
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/MacPherson1.png\">
</p>
It has three frame
connectors. The lower left one (frame_C) is fixed in the vehicle chassis. The
upper left one (frame_S) is driven by the steering mechanism, i.e., the
movement of both frames are given. The frame connector on the right (frame_U)
drives the wheel. The three frames are connected by a mechanism consisting
essentially of two rods with spherical joints on both ends. These are built up
by a jointUPS and a jointSSR assembly.
As can be seen, the universal joint from the jointUPS
assembly is connected to the revolute joint of the jointSSR assembly.
Therefore, we have 3 revolute joints connected together at one point and if
the axes of rotations are chosen appropriately, this describes a spherical
joint. In other words, the two connected assemblies define the desired two
rods with spherical joints on each ends.
</p>
<p>
The movement of the chassis, frame_C, is computed
somewhere else. When the generalized coordinates of revolute joint
\"innerJoint\" (lower left part in figure) are used as states, then frame_a and
frame_b of the jointUPS joint can be calculated. After the non-linear loop
with jointUPS is (analytically) solved, all frames on this assembly are
known, especially,
the one connected to frame_b of the jointSSR assembly. Since frame_b of
jointSSR is connected to frame_S which is computed from the steering
mechanism, again the two required frame movements of the jointSSR assembly are
calculated, meaning in turn that also all other frames on the jointSSR
assembly can be computed, especially, the one connected to frame_U that drives
the wheel. From this analysis it is clear that a tool is able to solve these
coupled loops analytically.
</p>
<p>
Another example is the model of the V6 engine,
see next figure for an animation view and the original definition
of one cylinder with elementary joints.

It is sufficient to rewrite the basic cylinder model
by replacing the joints with a JointRRP object that has two
revolute and one prismatic joint, see next figure.
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_4.png\">
</p>
<p>
Since 6
cylinders are connected together, 6 coupled loops with 6 JointRRP objects are
present. This model is available as
<a href=\"Modelica://MultiBodyOmc.Examples.Loops.EngineV6_analytic\">
MultiBodyOmc.Examples.Loops.EngineV6_analytic</a>.
</p>
<p>
The composition diagram of the connected 6 cylinders is
shown in the next figure
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/Tutorial/LoopStructures/EngineV6_1.png\">
</p>
<p>
It can be seen that the revolute joint
of the crank shaft (joint \"bearing\" in left part of figure) might be
selected as degree of freedom. Then the 4 connector frames of all cylinders
can be computed. As a result the computations of the cylinders are decoupled
from each other. Within one cylinder
the position of frame_a and frame_b of the jointRRP assembly
can be computed and therefore the generalized coordinates of the two revolute
and the prismatic joint in the jointRRP object can be determined. From this
analysis it is not surprising that a Modelica translator, such as Dymola,
is able to transform the DAE
equations into a sequential evaluation without any non-linear loop.
Compare this nice result with the model using only elementary joints
that leads to a DAE with 6 algebraic loops and 5 non-linear equations per
loop. Additionally, a linear system of equations of order 43 is present.
The simulation time is about 5 times faster with the analytic loop handling.

The MultiBodyOmc library has the feature that all components
can be connected together in a nearly arbitrary fashion.
Therefore, kinematic loop structures pose in principal
no problems. In this section several examples are given,
the special treatment of planar loops is discussed and it is explained
how a kinematic loop structure can be modeled such that the
occuring non-linear algebraic equation systems are solved
analytically. There are the following sub-chapters:

    annotation (Documentation(info="<HTML>
<p>
If different versions of the MultiBodyOmc library are not
compatible to each other, corresponding conversion scripts are
provided. As a result, models build with an older version
of the MultiBodyOmc library are automatically converted to the
new version when the model is loaded. The user is prompted
whether automatic conversion shall take place or not.
Problems are not to be expected. Still one should first make
a copy of such a model as backup before the conversion
is performed.
</p>
<p>
<b><font color=\"#008000\">Upgrade from ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc</font></b>
</p>
<p>
There is now also a conversion script from the \"old\"
<b>ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc</b> library to the
\"new\" MultiBodyOmc library. This script is also
automatically invoked. Since the differences between the \"old\" and the
\"new\" MultiBodyOmc library are so large, not everything is
converted and it might be that some pieces have to
be adapted manually. Still, this script is useful, since
many class names, parameters and modifiers are
automatically converted.
</p>
<p>
Components from the following sublibraries
are automatically converted
to the MultiBodyOmc library:
</p>
<ul>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc.Parts</li>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc.Joints</li>
<li> ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc.Forces</li>
<li> Part of ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc.Interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>
Models using the ModelicaAdditions.MultiBodyOmc library
that are programmed with <b>equations</b> are only partly converted:
The Frame connectors will be converted to the \"new\"
Frame connectors of the MultiBodyOmc library, but the equations
that reference variables of the Frame connectors will
<b>not</b> be converted. For a manual conversion, the following
table might be helpful showing how the <b>variables</b> of the
\"old\" and the \"new\" <b>Frame connectors</b> are
related to each other (resolve2 and angularVelocity2 are
functions from library MultiBodyOmc.Frames):

<b><font color=\"#008000\">Upgrade from MultiBodyOmc 0.99 (and earlier) to 1.0 (and later)</font></b>
<p>
The conversion from MultiBodyOmc 0.99 to 1.0 does not work in some rare
cases, where own components are implemented using functions of the
MultiBodyOmc.Frames package. In this case, the conversion has to be
performed manually. The changes in 1.0 with regards to 0.99 are:
</p>
<p>
The definition of the MultiBodyOmc.Frames.Orientation object has changed.
In 0.99 this was just an alias type for a transformation matrix
(now MultiBodyOmc.Frames.TransformationMatrices.Orientation).
In 1.0 the orientation object is a record holding the
transformation matrix from frame 1 to frame 2 and the angular
velocity of the transformation matrix resolved in frame 2.
The reason is that this allows to compute the angular velocity
in many cases by standard recursive formulas and not by
differentiation of the transformation matrix. This is usually
much more efficient. As a consequence, the following
calls in 0.99 should be changed:
</p>
<pre>
   Frames.angularVelocity1(T,der(T)) -> Frames.angularVelocity1(T)
   Frames.angularVelocity2(T,der(T)) -> Frames.angularVelocity2(T)
   Frames.from_T(T)                  -> Frames.from_T2(T,der(T))

Model <b>World</b> represents a global coordinate system fixed in
ground. This model serves several purposes:
<ul>
<li> It is used as <b>inertial system</b> in which
     the equations of all elements of the MultiBodyOmc library
     are defined.</li>
<li> It is the world frame of an <b>animation window</b> in which
     all elements of the MultiBodyOmc library are visualized.</li>
<li> It is used to define the <b>gravity field</b> in which a
     multi-body model is present. Default is a uniform gravity
     field where the gravity acceleration vector g is the
     same at every position. Additionally, a point gravity field
     can be selected.</li>
<li> It is used to define <b>default settings</b> of animation properties
     (e.g. the diameter of a sphere representing by default
     the center of mass of a body, or the diameters of the cylinders
     representing a revolute joint).</li>
<li> It is used to define a <b>visual representation</b> of the
     world model (= 3 coordinate axes with labels) and of the defined
     gravity field.<br>
    <IMG SRC=\"../Images/MultiBodyOmc/world.png\" ALT=\"MultiBodyOmcs.World\">
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since the gravity field function is required from all bodies with mass
and the default settings of animation properties are required
from nearly every component, exactly one instance of model World needs
to be present in every model on the top level. The basic declaration
needs to be:
</p>
<pre>
    <b>inner</b> MultiBodyOmc.World world
</pre>
<p>
Note, it must be an <b>inner</b> declaration with instance name <b>world</b>
in order that this world object can be accessed from all objects in the
model. When dragging the \"World\" object from the package browser into
the diagram layer, this declaration is automatically generated
(this is defined via annotations in model World).
</p>
<p>
All vectors and tensors of a mechanical system are resolved in a
frame that is local to the corresponding component. Usually,
if all relative joint coordinates vanish, the local frames
of all components are parallel to each other, as well as to the
world frame (this holds as long as a Parts.FixedRotation,
component is <b>not</b> used). In this \"reference configuration\"
it is therefore
alternatively possible to resolve all vectors in the world
frame, since all frames are parallel to each other.
This is often very convenient. In order to give some visual
support in such a situation, in the icon of a World instance
two axes of the world frame are shown and the labels
of these axes can be set via parameters.
