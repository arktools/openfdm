*
*   Model-Specific notes:
*      o The CG locations were based on 1/4 chord. Adjust weight to meet this
*        assumption.
*
*   General Notes :
*      1. In general, we aren't concerned with anything faster than the 
*         subsonic speed regime. DATCOM can handle transonic, supersonic, 
*         and hypersonic, so check the book for more information.
*
*      2. DATCOM pg 47 states :
* 
*           "In general, the eight flap types defined using SYMFLP
*           (variable FTYPE) are assumed to be located on the most
*           aft lifting surface, either horizontal tail or wing if 
*           a horizontal tail is not defined."
* 
*         We are going to assume that this means that we will have to
*         perform a wing-body-vertical_tail analysis in order to get
*         the flap effects, then add the horizontal tail in order to 
*         get it's effects and trim points. The first case is used
*         ONLY to get the flap effects.

*   List of Command Card
************************
*
*   Note : Command cards MUST start in column 1. They may appear in
*          any order, with the exception of NEXT CASE.
*
* NAMELIST  The contents of each applicatble namelist is dumped for the
*           case in the input system of units. (Very useful to see 
*           input parameter values).
* SAVE      Preserve the input data for the case to be used in the following 
*           cases. This would be useful if multiple or comparison cases
*           are built.
* DIM FT    Sets the system units of measure. Options are FT, IN, M, CM
* NEXT CASE Terminates the reading of input cards and begins execution of
*           the case. Case data are destroyed following execution of a case,
*           unless the SAVE card is present.
* TRIM      Trim calculations will be performed for each subsonic Mach number 
*           within the case. A vehicle may be trimmed by deflecting a control
*           device on the wing or horizontal tail or by deflecting an 
*           all-moveable horizontal stabilizer.
* DAMP      Provides dynamic-derivative results in addition to the standard
*           static-derivative output
* CASEID    Provides a case identification that is printed as part of the
*           output header.
* DUMP ALL  Prints the contents of the named arrays in the foot-pound-second
*           system. See Appendix C for list of arrays and their contents.
* DUMP CASE will print all the arrays that are used during case
*           execution prior to the conventional output. (Not particularily
*           useful, as all data is in nasty arrays)
* DUMP INPT will print dump of all input data blocks used for the case.
*           (also not useful)
* DUMP IOM  will print all the output arrays for the case. (not useful)
* DUMP ALL  will print all program arrays, even if not used for the case.
*           (surprisingly, not useful)
* DERIV DEG Defines the output units of measure for the static and dynamic
*           stability derivatives, either RAD or DEG. The following parameters
*           are affected: CLa, Cma, Cyb, Cnb, Clb, CLq, Cmq, Clp, Cyp, Cnp,
*           Cnr, Clr, CLad, CMad. JSBSim XML output is also switched between 
*           degrees and radians for alpha, beta, etc.
* PART      Provides auxiliary and partial outputs at each Mach number in the
*           case. These outputs are automatically provided for all cases at
*           transonic Mach numbers.
* BUILD     This command provides configuration build-up data. Conventional
*           static and dynamic stability data are output for a LOT of items.
* PLOT      Causes data generated by the program to be written to logical 
*           unit 13, which can be retained for input to the Plot Module.
*           (Looks like it dumps the data arrays out in column format. Not
*           too useful).

*           According to the DATCOM, the ground effects become neglible

*           span, so to keep our tables smooth, let's make the last

*  IMPORTANT NOTE: The effects of POWER are including in the DATCOM
*  output file (Citation.out in this case), at the bottom where the
*  total aircraft parameters are listed (CD, CL, CM, etc.). For the
*  Datcom+ output files, the power effects are removed and presented
*  (if not now, they will be some day) in a separate table. That way,
*  you can interpolate to get power settings between zero (off) and
*  whatever the maximum that you specify here.

*   AIETLJ  Angle of incidence of engine thrust line, deg
*   AMBSTP  Ambient static pressure
*   AMBTMP  Ambient temperature, deg
